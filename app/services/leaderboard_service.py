"""
Leaderboard service — ranking, trend, cache and SSE push.

Read path: one query on teams (trend comes from teams.current_rank vs
teams.previous_rank), cached for CACHE_TTL seconds and refreshed on every push.
Write path: after a vote commits, schedule_push() coalesces pushes per event so
a burst of payments costs one rebuild + one broadcast per window.
